How the Game Works:

quit the game when every you want.)

Level 1 Gameplay:
The game displays bird, catapult, blocks and pigs. the game has pause button where we restart, resume, or go back to main me
we added the dummy win and lose buttons where when we touch the button we are able to see the win and lose page and also able to
replay, go back to main menu or directly trigger win/lose scenarios using the respective buttons.

Level 2 Gameplay :
we just added the background in game with pause button, same for Level 3 screen.
